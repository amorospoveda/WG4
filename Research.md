Brief description: A corpus of verbal multiword expressions (VMWEs) was manually annotated. This paper describes the process of annotating the corpus in the Polish language using PARSEME 1.2. The manual annotations revealed insights such as interactions between tokens, lemmas, morphology, and syntax, as well as some new PARSEME guidelines.
